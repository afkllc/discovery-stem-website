## ℹ️ Shopify integration removed

This repository was originally a Shopify storefront boilerplate. For your project the shop and Shopify-specific functionality has been removed — you do not need to set up Shopify tokens or import demo products. If you want to re-enable Shopify later, you can recover the original code from git history.
