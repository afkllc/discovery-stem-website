This directory holds the branding assets for Discovery STEM Education.

Required files:

- `discovery-stem-logo.png`   – primary logo (light-background version)
- `discovery-stem-logo-dark.png` – dark-background version (used when dark mode is active)
- `favicon.png`              – 32x32 or 48x48 favicon (optional, can reuse the small logo icon)

Place the images you attached to your last message here and ensure the filenames match exactly. You may need to resize them to roughly 150×33 pixels for the header logo; the dark version should be visually identical but with colors adjusted for dark backgrounds. The favicon should be a square graphic, 32×32 is typical.
